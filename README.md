# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project is focused on building a predictive model for breast cancer using logistic regression. The aim is to accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on a set of input features. This readme file provides an overview of the project, including the dataset used, the methodology employed, and instructions for running the code.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various characteristics of breast tumors. Each instance in the dataset represents a patient's tumor, and the corresponding features include details such as tumor size, texture, smoothness, symmetry, etc. The dataset also includes the target variable, indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Methodology
The project follows these major steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. It is also split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected to build the logistic regression model. This step involves analyzing the correlation between features and the target variable, and choosing the most informative ones.

3. Model Training: The logistic regression model is trained on the selected features using the training dataset. This involves fitting the model to the data and estimating the coefficients for each feature.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the effectiveness of the model in predicting breast cancer.

5. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the likelihood of breast cancer for new, unseen tumors. These predictions are based on the selected features and the estimated coefficients from the logistic regression model.

# Results and Discussion
The results of the logistic regression model, including evaluation metrics and predictions, will be displayed in the console or saved to a file (as specified in the script). You can analyze these results to understand the model's performance and its ability to predict breast cancer accurately.

It is important to interpret the results carefully and consider the limitations of the logistic regression model. Further analysis and validation may be required before making any conclusive decisions based on the model's predictions.
